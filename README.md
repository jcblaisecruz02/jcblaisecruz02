### Hi! 👋 My name is Blaise Cruz.

I’m a researcher at [Samsung Research Philippines](https://research.samsung.com/srph) where I specialize in NLP problems constrained under low-resource settings. I'm also affiliated with the [DLSU Center for Language Technologies](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/adric/celt/) as a research consultant.

- 💬 My work revolves around creative approaches to solving NLP tasks constrained with little data.
- ⚙️ I develop [models and datasets](https://www.blaisecruz.com/resources/) for the low-resource Filipino language.
- 🤗 My pretrained Filipino transformers are available at HuggingFace under my username [`jcblaise`](https://huggingface.co/jcblaise)
- 🌏 You can visit my website [blaisecruz.com](blaisecruz.com) for Filipino NLP papers and resources.
- 😅 Fun Fact: I'm the author of the [Cramming Professor Meme](https://www.google.com/search?q=cramming+professor+meme) tweet.

If you’re interested in collaborating or if you want to chat about low-resource languages, feel free to get in touch! You may reach me through my email `me (at) blaisecruz (dot) com`.
